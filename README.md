# Conways Game of Life
A solution to Rails Conf 2018 [live pairing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEf6iUIkjf4).

## Rules
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
